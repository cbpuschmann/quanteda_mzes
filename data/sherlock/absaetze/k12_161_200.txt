"That is the letter which I have just received, Mr. Holmes, and my mind is made up that I will accept it.
I thought, how- ever, that before taking the final step I should like to submit the whole matter to your consideration."
"Well, Miss Hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the question," said Holmes, smiling.
"But you would not advise me to refuse?"
"I confess that it is not the situation which I should like to see a sister of mine apply for."
"What is the meaning of it all, Mr. Holmes?"
"Ah, I have no data.
I cannot tell.
Perhaps you have yourself formed some opinion?"
"Well, there seems to me to be only one possible solution.
Mr. Rucastle seemed to be a very kind, good-natured man.
Is it not possible that his wife is a lunatic, that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum, and that he humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an outbreak?"
"That is a possible solution -- in fact, as matters stand, it is the most probable one.
But in any case it does not seem to be a nice household for a young lady."
"But the money, Mr. Holmes the money!"
"Well, yes, of course the pay is good -- too good.
That is what makes me uneasy.
Why should they give you 120 pounds a year, when they could have their pick for 40 pounds?
There must be some strong reason behind."
"I thought that if I told you the circumstances you would understand afterwards if I wanted your help.
I should feel so much stronger if I felt that you were at the back of me."
"Oh, you may carry that feeling away with you.
I assure you that your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my way for some months.
There is something dis- tinctly novel about some of the features.
If you should find yourself in doubt or in danger --"   "Danger!
What danger do you foresee?"
Holmes shook his head gravely.
"It would cease to be a danger if we could define it," said he.
"But at any time, day or night, a telegram would bring me down to your help."
"That is enough."
She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all swept from her face.
"I shall go down to Hampshire quite easy in my mind now.
I shall write to Mr. Rucastle at once, sacrifice my poor hair to-night, and start for Winchester to-morrow."
With a few grateful words to Holmes she bade us both good-night and bustled off upon her way.
"At least," said I as we heard her quick, firm steps descend- ing the stairs, "she seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take care of herself."
"And she would need to be," said Holmes gravely.
"I am much mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past."
It was not very long before my friend's prediction was ful- filled.
A fortnight went by, during which I frequently found my thoughts turning in her direction and wondering what strange side-alley of human experience this lonely woman had strayed into.
The unusual salary, the curious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to something abnormal, though whether a fad or a plot, or whether the man were a philanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond my powers to determine.
