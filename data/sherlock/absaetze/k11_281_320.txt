The whole gar- den has already been minutely examined."
"Now, my dear sir," said Holmes. "is it not obvious to you now that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the police were at first inclined to think?
It appeared to you to be a simple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex.
Consider what is involved by your theory.
You suppose that your son came down from his bed, went. at great risk, to your dressing-room, opened your bureau, took out your coronet, broke otf by main force a small portion of it, went off to some other place, concealed three gems out of the thirty-nine. with such skill that nobody can find them, and then returned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger of being discovered.
I ask you now, is such a theory tenable?"
"But what other is there?"
cried the banker with a gesture of despair.
"If his motives were innocent, why does he not explain them?"
"It is our task to find that out," replied Holmes; "so now, if you please, Mr. Holder, we will set off for Streatham together, and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into details."
My friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expe- dition, which I was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened.
I confess that the guilt of the banker's son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father, but still I had such faith in Holmes's judgment that I felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation.
He hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought.
Our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a desultory chat with me over his business affairs.
A short railway journey and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest residence of the great financier.
Fairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, stand- ing back a little from the road.
A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn, stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the entrance.
On the right side was a small wooden thicket, which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door, and forming the tradesmen's entrance.
On the left ran a lane which led to the stables, and was not itself within the grounds at all, being a public, though little used, thoroughfare.
Holmes left us standing at the door and walked slowly all round the house, across the front, down the tradesmen's path, and so round by the garden behind into the stable lane.
So long was he that Mr. Holder and I went into the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return.
We were sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in.
She was rather above the middle height, slim, with dark hair and eyes, which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin.
I do not think that I have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman's face.
Her lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying.
As she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character, with immense capacity for self-restraint.
Disre- garding my presence, she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress.
"You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you not, dad?"
she asked.
"No, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom."
"But I am so sure that he is innocent.
You know what woman's instincts are.
I know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for having acted so harshly."
"Why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?"
"Who knows?
Perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect him."
"How could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with the coronet in his hand?"
"Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it.
Oh, do, do take my word for it that he is innocent.
Let the matter drop and say no more.
