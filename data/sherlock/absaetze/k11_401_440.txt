There would be a noise like a pistol shot.
Do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard nothing of it?"
"I do not know what to think.
It is all dark to me."
"But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go.
What do you think, Miss Holder?"
"I confess that I still share my uncle's perplexity."
"Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?"
"He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt."
"Thank you.
We have certainly been favoured with extraordi- nary luck during this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up.
With your pemmission, Mr. Holder, I shall now continue my investigations outside."
He went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult.
For an hour or more he was at work, returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever.
"I think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr. Holder," said he; "I can serve you best by returning to my rooms."
"But the gems, Mr. Holmes.
Where are they?"
"I cannot tell."
The banker wrung his hands.
"I shall never see them again!"
he cried.
"And my son?
You give me hopes?"
"My opinion is in no way altered."
"Then, for God's sake, what was this dark business which was acted in my house last night?"
"If you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow morning between nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to make it clearer.
I understand that you give me carte blanche to act for you, provided only that I get back the gems, and that you place no limit on the sum I may draw."
"I would give my fortune to have them back."
"Very good.
I shall look into the matter between this and then.
Good-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come over here again before evening."
It was obvious to me that my companion's mind was now made up about the case, although what his conclusions were was more than I could even dimly imagine.
Several times during our homeward journey I endeavoured to sound him upon the point, but he always glided away to some other topic, until at last I gave it over in despair.
It was not yet three when we found ourselves in our rooms once more.
He hurried to his chamber and was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer.
With his collar turned up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and his worn boots, he was a perfect sample of the class.
"I think that this should do," said he, glancing into the glass above the fireplace. "l only wish that you could come with me, Watson, but I fear that it won't do.
I may be on the trail in this matter, or I may be following a will-o'-the-wisp, but I shall soon know which it is.
I hope that I may be back in a few hours."
He cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard, sandwiched it between two rounds of bread, and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition.
