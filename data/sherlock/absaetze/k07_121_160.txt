Has it returned to life and flapped off through the kitchen window?"
Holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get a fairer view of the man's excited face.
"See here, sir!
See what my wife found in its crop!"
He held out his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly scintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the dark hollow of his hand.
Sherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle.
"By Jove, Peterson!"
said he, "this is treasure trove indeed.
I suppose you know what you have got?"
"A diamond, sir?
A precious stone.
It cuts into glass as though it were putty."
"It's. more than a precious stone.
It is the precious stone."
"Not the Countess of Morcar's blue carbuncle!"
I ejaculated.
"Precisely so. l ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I have read the advertisement about it in The Times every day lately.
It is absolutely unique, and its value can only be conjec- tured, but the reward offered of 1000 pounds is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market price."
"A thousand pounds!
Great Lord of mercy!"
The commis- sionaire plumped down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us.
"That is the reward, and I have reason to know that there are sentimental considerations in the background which would in- duce the Countess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover the gem."
"It was lost, if I remember aright, at the Hotel Cosmopoli- tan," I remarked.
"Precisely so, on December 22d, just five days ago.
John Horner, a plumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the lady's jewel-case.
The evidence against him was so strong that the case has been referred to the Assizes.
I have some account of the matter here, I believe."
He rummaged amid his newspapers, glancing over the dates, until at last he smoothed one out, doubled it over, and read the following paragraph:               "Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery.
John Horner, 26,             plumber, was brought up upon the charge of having upon             the 22d inst., abstracted from the jewel-case of the Countess             of Morcar the valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle.
James Ryder, upper-attendant at the hotel, gave his evi-             dence to the effect that he had shown Horner up to the             dressing-room of the Countess of Morcar upon the day of             the robbery in order that he might solder the second bar of             the grate, which was loose.
He had remained with Horner             some little time, but had finally been called away.
On             returning, he found that Horner had disappeared, that the             bureau had been forced open, and that the small morocco             casket in which, as it afterwards transpired, the Countess             was accustomed to keep her jewel, was lying empty upon             the dressing-table.
Ryder instantly gave the alarm, and Horner             was arrested the same evening; but the stone could not be             found either upon his person or in his rooms.
Catherine             Cusack, maid to the Countess, deposed to having heard             Ryder's cry of dismay on discovering the robbery, and to             having rushed into the room, where she found matters as             described by the last witness.
Inspector Bradstreet, B divi-             sion, gave evidence as to the arrest of Horner, who strug-             gled frantically, and protested his innocence in the strongest             terms.
Evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having             been given against the prisoner, the magistrate refused to             deal summarily with the offence, but referred it to the             Assizes.
Horner, who had shown signs of intense emotion             during the proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion and             was carried out of court.
"Hum!
So much for the police-court," said Holmes thought- fully, tossing aside the paper.
"The question for us now to solve is the sequence of events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to the crop of a goose in Tottenham Court Road at the other.
