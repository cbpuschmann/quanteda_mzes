"Our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase.
All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down."
"I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase," observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily.
"You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir," said the police agent loftily.
"He has his own little meth- ods, which are, if he won't mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in him.
It is not too much to say that once or twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the official force."
"Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right," said the stranger with deference.
"Still, I confess that I miss my rubber.
It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my rubber."
"I think you will find," said Sherlock Holmes, "that you will play for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play will be more exciting.
For you, Mr. Merryweather, the stake will be some 30,000 pounds; and for you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands."
"John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger.
He's a young man, Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London.
He's a remarkable man, is young John Clay.
His grandfather was a royal duke, and he himself has been to Eton and Oxford.
His brain is as cunning.as his fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never know where to find the man himself.
He'll crack a crib in Scotland one week, and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next.
I've been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet."
"I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night.
I've had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I agree with you that he is at the head of his profes- sion.
It is past ten, however, and quite time that we started.
If you two will take the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the second."
Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon.
We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets until we emerged into Farrington Street.
"We are close there now," my friend remarked.
"This fellow Merryweather is a bank director, and personally interested in the matter.
I thought it as well to have Jones with us also.
He is not a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession.
He has one positive virtue.
He is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone.
Here we are, and they are waiting for us."
We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning.
Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door, which he opened for us.
Within there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate.
This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated at another formi- dable gate.
Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes.
"You are not very vulnerable from above," Holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him.
"Nor from below," said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor.
"Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!"
he remarked, looking up in surprise.
