Those are the principal points about which I wished to be absolutely clear.
We shall now have a little supper and then retire, for we may have a very busy day to-morrow."
A large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our disposal, and I was quickly between the sheets, for I was weary after my night of adventure.
Sherlock Holmes was a man, however, who, when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for days, and even for a week, without rest, turning it over, rearranging his facts, looking at it from every point of view until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his data were insufficient.
It was soon evident to me that he was now preparing for an all-night sitting.
He took off his coat and waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, and then wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from the sofa and armchairs.
With these he constructed a sort of Eastern divan, upon which he perched himself cross- legged, with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him.
In the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there, an old briar pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless, with the light shining upon his strong-set aquiline features.
So he sat as I dropped off to sleep, and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up, and I found the summer sun shining into the apartment.
The pipe was still between his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the room was full of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap of shag which I had seen upon the previous night.
"Awake, Watson?"
he asked.
"Yes."
"Game for a morning drive?"
"Certainly."
"Then dress.
No one is stirring yet, but I know where the stable-boy sleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out."
He chuckled to himself as he spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night.
As I dressed I glanced at my watch.
It was no wonder that no one was stirring.
It was twenty-five minutes past four.
I had hardly finished when Holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse.
"I want to test a little theory of mine," said he, pulling on his boots.
"I think, Watson, that you are now standing in the presence of one of the most absolute fools in Europe.
I deserve to be kicked from here to Charing Cross.
But I think I have the key of the affair now."
"And where is it?"
I asked, smiling.
"In the bathroom," he answered.
"Oh, yes, I am not jok- ing," he continued, seeing my look of incredulity.
"I have just been there, and I have taken it out, and I have got it in this Gladstone bag.
Come on, my boy, and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock."
We made our way downstairs as quietly as possible, and out into the bright morning sunshine.
In the road stood our horse and trap, with the half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head.
We both sprang in, and away we dashed down the London Road.
A few country carts were stirring, bearing in vegetables to the metropo- lis, but the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream.
"It has been in some points a singular case," said Holmes, flicking the horse on into a gallop.
"I confess that I have been as blind as a mole, but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all."
In town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from their windows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey side.
Passing down the Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the river, and dashing up Wellington Street wheeled sharply to the right and found ourselves in Bow Street.
