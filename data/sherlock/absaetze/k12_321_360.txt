Mrs. Rucastle, however, who has evidently no sense of humour, never so much as smiled, but sat with her hands in her lap, and a sad, anxious look upon her face.
After an hour or so, Mr. Rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the day, and that I might change my dress and go to little Edward in the nursery.
"Two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly similar circumstances.
Again I changed my dress, again I sat in the window, and again I laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which my employer had an immense reper- toire, and which he told inimitably.
Then he handed me a yellow- backed novel, and moving my chair a little sideways, that my own shadow might not fall upon the page. he begged me to read aloud to him.
I read for about ten minutes, beginning in the heart of a chapter, and then suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he ordered me to cease and to change my dress.
"You can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious I became as to what the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be.
They were always very careful, I observed, to turn my face away from the window, so that I became consumed with the desire to see what was going on behind my back.
At first it seemed to be impossible, but I soon devised a means.
My hand-mirror had been broken, so a happy thought seized me, and I concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief.
On the next occasion, in the midst of my laughter, I put my handkerchief up to my eyes, and was able with a little management to see all that there was behind me.
I confess that I was disappointed.
There was nothing.
At least that was my first impression.
At the second glance, however, I perceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton Road, a small bearded man in a gray suit, who seemed to be looking in my direction.
The road is an important highway, and there are usually people there.
This man, however, was leaning against the railings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly up.
I lowered my handkerchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle to find her eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze.
She said nothing, but I am convinced that she had divined that I had a mirror in my hand and had seen what was behind me.
She rose at once.
" 'Jephro,' said she, 'there is an impertinent fellow upon the road there who stares up at Miss Hunter.'
" 'No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?'
he asked.
" 'No, I know no one in these parts.'
" 'Dear me!
How very impertinent!
Kindly turn round and motion to him to go away.'
" 'Surely it would be better to take no notice.'
" 'No, no, we should have him loitering here always.
Kindly turn round and wave him away like that.'
"I did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew down the blind.
That was a week ago, and from that time I have not sat again in the window, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor seen the man in the road."
"Pray continue," said Holmes.
"Your narrative promises to be a most interesting one."
"You will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may prove to be little relation between the different incidents of which I speak.
On the very first day that I was at the Copper Beeches, Mr. Rucastle took me to a small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door.
As we approached it I heard the sharp rattling of a chain, and the sound as of a large animal moving about.
" 'Look in here!'
said Mr. Rucastle, showing me a slit be- tween two planks.
'Is he not a beauty?'
