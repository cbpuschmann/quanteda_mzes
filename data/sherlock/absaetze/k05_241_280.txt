John Swain cleared.      12th.
Visited Paramore.
All well.
"Thank you!"
said Holmes, folding up the paper and return- ing it to our visitor.
"And now you must on no account lose another instant.
We cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me.
You must get home instantly and act."
"What shall I do?"
"There is but one thing to do.
It must be done at once.
You must put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which you have described.
You must also put in a note to say that all the other papers were burned by your uncle, and that this is the only one which remains.
You must assert that in such words as will carry conviction with them.
Having done this, you must at once put the box out upon the sundial, as directed.
Do you understand?"
"Entirely."
"Do not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present.
I think that we may gain that by means of the law; but we have our web to weave, while theirs is already woven.
The first consideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens you.
The second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the guilty parties."
"I thank you," said the young man, rising and pulling on his overcoat.
"You have given me fresh life and hope.
I shall certainly do as you advise."
"Do not lose an instant.
And, above all, take care of yourself in the meanwhile, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger.
How do you go back?
"By train from Waterloo."
"It is not yet nine.
The streets will be crowded, so l trust that you may be in safety.
And yet you cannot guard yourself too closely."
"I am armed."
"That is well.
To-morrow I shall set to work upon your case."
"I shall see you at Horsham, then?"
"No, your secret lies in London.
It is there that I shall seek it."
"Then I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news as to the box and the papers.
I shall take your advice in every particular."
He shook hands with us and took his leave.
