Even a wife's eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise.
But then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and that the clothes might betray me.
I threw open the window, reopen- ing by my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that morning.
Then I seized my coat, which was weighted by the coppers which I had just transferred to it from the leather bag in which I carried my takings.
I hurled it out of the window, and it disappered into the Thames.
The other clothes would have followed, but at that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair, and a few minutes after I found, rather, I confess, to my relief, that instead of being identified as Mr. Neville St. Clair, I was arrested as his murderer.
"I do not know that there is anything else for me to explain.
I was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and hence my preference for a dirty face.
Knowing that my wife would be terribly anxious, I slipped off my ring and confided it to the lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me, together with a hurried scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to fear."
"That note only reached her yesterday," said Holmes.
"Good God!
What a week she must have spent!"
"The police have watched this lascar," said Inspector Brad- street, "and I can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter unobserved.
Probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his, who forgot all about it for some days."
"That was it," said Holmes, nodding approvingly; "I have no doubt of it.
But have you never been prosecuted for begging?"
"Many times; but what was a fine to me?"
"It must stop here, however," said Bradstreet.
"If the police are to hush this thing up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone."
"I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take."
"In that case I think that it is probable that no further steps may be taken.
But if you are found again, then all must come out.
I am sure, Mr. Holmes, that we are very moch indebted to you for having cleared the matter up.
I wish I knew how you reach your results."
"I reached this one," said my friend, "by sitting upon five pillows and consuming an ounce of shag.
I think, Watson, that if we drive to Baker Street we shall just be in time for breakfast."
