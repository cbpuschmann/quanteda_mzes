Suppose that this man Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair through the window, there is no human eye which could have seen the deed.
What would he do then?
It would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the tell-tale garments.
He would seize the coat, then, and be in the act of throwing it out, when it would occur to him that it would swim and not sink.
He has little time, for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried to force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard from his lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street.
There is not an instant to be lost.
He rushes to some secret hoard, where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure of the coat's sinking.
He throws it out, and would have done the same with the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below, and only just had time to close the window when the police appeared."
"It certainly sounds feasible."
"Well, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better.
Boone, as I have told you, was arrested and taken to the station, but it could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against him.
He had for years been known as a profes- sional beggar, but his life appeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one.
There the matter stands at present, and the ques- tions which have to be solved -- what Neville St. Clair was doing in the opium den, what happened to him when there, where is he now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his disappearance -- are all as far from a solution as ever.
I confess that I cannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties."
While Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular se- ries of events, we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great town until the last straggling houses had been left behind, and we rattled along with a country hedge upon either side of us.
Just as he finished, however, we drove through two scattered villages, where a few lights still glimmered in the windows.
"We are on the outskirts of Lee," said my companion.
"We have touched on three English counties in our short drive. start- ing in Middlesex, passing over an angle of Surrey, and ending in Kent.
See that light among the trees?
That is The Cedars, and beside that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already, I have little doubt, caught the clink of our horse's feet."
"But why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street?"
I asked.
"Because there are many inquiries which must be made out here.
Mrs. St. Clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal, and you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for my friend and colleague.
I hate to meet her, Watson, when I have no news of her husband.
Here we are.
Whoa, there, whoa!"
We had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own grounds.
A stable-boy had run out to the horse's head, and springing down I followed Holmes up the small, winding gravel-drive which led to the house.
As we approached, the door flew open, and a little blonde woman stood in the opening, clad in some sort of light mousseline de soie, with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists.
She stood with her figure outlined against the flood of light, one hand upon the door, one half-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly bent, her head and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a standing question.
"Well?"
she cried, "well?"
And then, seeing that there were two of us, she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.
"No good news?"
"None."
"No bad?"
"No."
"Thank God for that.
But come in.
